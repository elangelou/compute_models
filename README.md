Forecasting compute intensiveness for alignment research

This interactive page is designed to inform a compute strategy for automated alignment research addressing the following: 

- What would the compute be used for, considering different timelines and scenarios for when we get AGI
- A ranking of automation difficulty for various late-stage alignment research tasks
- Estimating compute intensiveness for different tasks following different agendas
